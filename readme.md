# Digital Witness Protection

This confidential GitHub repository supports a private, invitation-only program created for individuals who have experienced repeated identity theft, cyberstalking, or online fraud. 

Victims are often ignored by law enforcement or denied the ability to even file a report. As a result, attackers grow bolder, smarter, and harder to stop. This program exists to reverse that trend.

## Purpose

Our aim is to:
- Protect digital victims from ongoing attacks.
- Use controlled, active deception to confuse and ultimately identify the attacker.
- Enable the victim to gather enough information so they or their legal counsel can pursue action.
- Serve as a digital archive to support legal, ethical, and emotional recovery from online abuse.

## Why This Matters

Most cybercrimes go unreported. When victims are dismissed or discouraged from taking action, it sends a signal that attackers will face no consequence. This repository creates a structured, private environment to do something about it â€” intelligently, strategically, and legally.

**Access is restricted.** Only vetted individuals and their technical allies are granted access through private invitation.
